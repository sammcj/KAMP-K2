**KAMP (Klipper Adaptive Meshing & Purging) — Creality K2 fork**

A fork of [kyleisah/Klipper-Adaptive-Meshing-Purging](https://github.com/kyleisah/Klipper-Adaptive-Meshing-Purging) with the small amount of extra glue Creality K2 printers need to make KAMP actually work.

## What's different from upstream KAMP

Creality's K2 firmware does two things that break upstream KAMP out of the box (on the `CR0CN200400C10` board — K2, K2 Combo, K2 Pro). K2 Plus has a half-implemented Creality adaptive mesh on a different board but users report it's unreliable; this fork replaces that too.

1. **`prtouch_v3_wrapper.so` hijacks `BED_MESH_CALIBRATE`** with a non-adaptive implementation that ignores `MESH_MIN` / `MESH_MAX` / `PROBE_COUNT` and crashes with `IndexError` when those are passed. KAMP relies on the upstream Klipper handler being present, so KAMP calls fail silently or blow up.
2. **`master-server` daemon independently fires `G29` and `BED_MESH_CALIBRATE_START_PRINT`** during print prep, outside of any slicer start-gcode. Those fire before KAMP can run and triggers a stock full-bed mesh every time.
3. **Orca's K2 `change_filament_gcode` template drops Z to 0** immediately after `LINE_PURGE` at print start. The template uses `{z_after_toolchange}`, which is `0` before any layer has printed, so the nozzle scrapes from the post-purge position diagonally across the bed to the first print object. This is invisible in the slicer (it only manifests on first-print tool activation) and the upstream KAMP `Line_Purge.cfg` ends with a hardcoded 0.4 mm hop that isn't enough to escape it.

KAMP-K2 fixes all three:

- **`extras/restore_bed_mesh.py`** — a small Klipper extras module that re-registers the upstream `bed_mesh.BedMeshCalibrate.cmd_BED_MESH_CALIBRATE` handler, wrapping it with a guard that requires `MESH_MIN` / `MESH_MAX` bounds to run. Bare calls (from master-server) are no-ops. KAMP-aware: detects KAMP's `rename_existing: _BED_MESH_CALIBRATE` and overrides the inner handler so KAMP stays the user-facing entry point.
- **Macro hijacks**: `G29` and `BED_MESH_CALIBRATE_START_PRINT` are replaced with no-op macros that emit a fake `[G29_TIME]Execution time: 0.0` response so master-server's print-prep sequence is satisfied without actually running a mesh. The real mesh runs inside `START_PRINT` where KAMP has slicer metadata available.
- **`START_PRINT` patches**: a call to bare `BED_MESH_CALIBRATE` (which KAMP wraps with adaptive bounds) and a `LINE_PURGE` call are inserted in the right places relative to the K2's CFS-specific nozzle clean and prime moves.
- **`Line_Purge.cfg` Z-protection (v1.1.0)**: a new `purge_z_hop` variable in `KAMP_Settings.cfg` (default `2.0` mm) controls the post-purge clearance. `LINE_PURGE` applies `SET_GCODE_OFFSET Z=purge_z_hop` at the end of the purge so Orca's subsequent `G1 Z0` lands safely at the hop height instead of the bed. A `G92` override (rename_existing: G92.1) clears the offset on the slicer's first post-purge `G92 E0` — emitted in the layer-change block, between the bad Z=0 line and the first real layer Z move — so the first-layer height is unaffected. No slicer config changes needed.

This fork modifies upstream KAMP's `Line_Purge.cfg` and `KAMP_Settings.cfg` to add the Z-protection above; `Adaptive_Meshing.cfg` and `Voron_Purge.cfg` are unchanged.

## Quick start

### Windows (one-liner, no git needed)

Open **PowerShell** (not cmd.exe) and paste:

```powershell
iwr -useb https://raw.githubusercontent.com/grant0013/KAMP-K2/main/bootstrap.ps1 | iex
```

The script checks for Python (prompts to install if missing), downloads the repo, installs `paramiko`, asks for your printer's IP, and runs the installer. No manual SSH required.

### macOS / Linux (one-liner)

Open a terminal and paste:

```sh
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/grant0013/KAMP-K2/main/install.sh | bash
```

Same flow as the Windows one-liner: checks for Python 3.8+ (prompts you how to install it if missing), creates an isolated venv, installs `paramiko`, clones the repo into `~/KAMP-K2`, asks for your printer's IP, and runs the installer. The venv sidesteps PEP 668 ("externally-managed-environment") errors on modern macOS / Ubuntu 23.04+ / Debian 12+ without needing `--break-system-packages`.

Non-interactive form (for scripts / re-runs):

```sh
~/KAMP-K2/install.sh --host 192.168.1.42
~/KAMP-K2/install.sh --host 192.168.1.42 --revert
```

### Manual / any OS

If you'd rather not run the installer:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/grant0013/KAMP-K2
cd KAMP-K2
python3 -m venv .venv && .venv/bin/pip install paramiko
.venv/bin/python install_k2.py --host 192.168.x.x
```

Replace `192.168.x.x` with your printer's IP. The installer uses the Creality stock root password (`creality_2024`) by default; override with `--password MYPASS` if yours has been changed.

See [`docs/INSTALL_K2.md`](docs/INSTALL_K2.md) for the step-by-step the installer performs (useful if you want to do it manually, or understand what's being changed).

### Re-applying after a Creality firmware update

Firmware updates revert the stock configs (`printer.cfg`, `gcode_macro.cfg`), so KAMP-K2 has to be re-applied afterwards. The printer's cut-down Python has no working `pip`/`venv`, so `install.sh` can't run on the printer itself (it fails at `ensurepip`). Run the installer **directly on the printer** with `--local` instead - no SSH, paramiko or venv:

```sh
ssh root@PRINTER_IP
cd ~/KAMP-K2 && git pull     # first time: git clone https://github.com/grant0013/KAMP-K2
python3 install_k2.py --local
```

`--local` is idempotent (safe to re-run): it re-copies the KAMP files, re-applies the config patches, and restarts Klippy. From your PC, the normal `--host` form still works.

## Compatibility

Two different boards in the K2 family behave differently:

| Printer | Board | Stock adaptive mesh? | KAMP-K2 needed? |
|---|---|---|---|
| **K2 / K2 Combo / K2 Pro** | `CR0CN200400C10` (F021) | **No** (no `forced_leveling` toggle in printer.cfg, wrapper doesn't support adaptive bounds) | **Yes — this is the only option** |
| **K2 Plus** | `CR0CN240319C13` (F008) | Yes, but **off by default** and forum-reported unreliable | Optional alternative; more maintainable than Creality's flaky toggle |
| K1 / K1C / K1 Max | CR4CU220812S* | No | Should work (same `prtouch_v3_wrapper` + master-server architecture); untested — please file an issue if you try it |
| K1 SE | CR4CU220812S12 | No | Unknown (wrapper may be `prtouch_v2`; minor path change in installer probably needed) |
| Non-Creality Klipper printer | — | — | **Don't use this fork** — use [upstream KAMP](https://github.com/kyleisah/Klipper-Adaptive-Meshing-Purging) directly; you don't have a wrapper to bypass |

**Adaptive line purging (`LINE_PURGE`) is *not* available in any Creality K-series stock firmware.** Even K2 Plus owners with Creality's built-in adaptive mesh working get no purge-line adaptation out of the box. KAMP-K2 brings both features on every variant it supports.

Tested on my K2 Combo (`CR0CN200400C10`, firmware `V1.1.4.1`, Klipper `09faed31-dirty`).

## Slicer setup

### Slicer compatibility

| Slicer | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **OrcaSlicer** | **Recommended / fully supported** | Free, emits `EXCLUDE_OBJECT_DEFINE` out of the box, placeholder syntax matches KAMP-K2's docs. All testing done here. |
| **Bambu Studio** | Expected to work | Same codebase as Orca, same placeholder syntax. Untested. |
| **PrusaSlicer / SuperSlicer** | Should work | Emits object metadata via "Label objects". Variable names differ slightly (see below). Untested. |
| **Creality Print** | **Partial / not recommended** | Emits `EXCLUDE_OBJECT_DEFINE` correctly (tick "Exclude objects" + "Label objects" under G-code output), so KAMP's adaptive mesh **will** run. HOWEVER: CP uses its own placeholder syntax that's incompatible with the custom start-gcode shown below, and its default start-gcode triggers Creality's built-in pre-print mesh sequence *in addition* to KAMP's — you end up with one full mesh + one adaptive mesh per print, wasting probe time. KAMP-K2 is primarily developed and tested against Orca. If you want full benefit, switch slicer. |

> **The rest of this setup section assumes OrcaSlicer.** If you use CP anyway, leave its default start-gcode alone — don't paste the Orca-specific lines below. KAMP will still run adaptively inside `START_PRINT`, you'll just also get CP's full mesh and corner purge on top.

### OrcaSlicer

**Printer Settings → Machine G-code → Machine start G-code** — replace the default with exactly these five lines:

```
START_PRINT EXTRUDER_TEMP=[nozzle_temperature_initial_layer] BED_TEMP=[bed_temperature_initial_layer_single]
T[initial_no_support_extruder]
LINE_PURGE
M204 S2000
M83
```

> **Forgot what to paste?** The installer auto-prints this block on fresh installs. To regenerate it any time:
> ```sh
> python3 ~/KAMP-K2/slicer_gcode.py                  # Orca (default)
> python3 ~/KAMP-K2/slicer_gcode.py --board F008     # K2 Plus (mesh max 345,345)
> ```

> **Why these exact lines, in this order**:
> - `START_PRINT` runs heating, homing, adaptive mesh, nozzle clean. Does **not** load filament (that's slicer-side on K2).
> - `T[initial_no_support_extruder]` triggers the CFS (or direct-drive loader) to actually pull filament to the nozzle.
> - `LINE_PURGE` **must come after T<n>** — if it runs before, there's no filament at the nozzle yet and you get an empty purge followed by an un-purged start (reported by [issue #1](https://github.com/grant0013/KAMP-K2/issues/1)).
> - `M204 S2000` + `M83` — accel limit + relative extrusion. Anything beyond these is usually the slicer's default fixed purge line, which wastes filament now that KAMP is doing an adaptive one.

**Print Settings → Others → Bed mesh** (match your `[bed_mesh]` section in printer.cfg):
- Bed mesh min: `5, 5`
- Bed mesh max: `255, 255` on K2/K2 Combo (260³), or `345, 345` on K2 Plus (350³) — read the `mesh_max:` line in your printer.cfg to be sure
- Probe point distance: `50, 50`
- Mesh margin: `5`

**Print Settings → Others → Output options**: make sure **Label objects** is enabled (this writes the `EXCLUDE_OBJECT_DEFINE` lines that KAMP reads).

**You do NOT need to pass `MESH_MIN` / `MESH_MAX` / `PROBE_COUNT`** — KAMP figures them out from the loaded gcode's `exclude_object` metadata.

To skip the adaptive mesh entirely on a specific slice (e.g. a calibration cube you don't care about), add `MESH=0` to the `START_PRINT` call:

```
START_PRINT EXTRUDER_TEMP=[...] BED_TEMP=[...] MESH=0
```

### Other slicers

Any slicer that supports `[exclude_object]` / object-labeled gcode output will work. PrusaSlicer, SuperSlicer, and Bambu Studio all do. The only requirement is that the `EXCLUDE_OBJECT_DEFINE` lines appear in the file **before** the `START_PRINT` call, so `printer.exclude_object.objects` is populated by the time KAMP reads it. OrcaSlicer does this by default; other slicers vary.

The [`slicer_gcode.py`](slicer_gcode.py) helper prints a ready-to-paste block for each supported slicer, with the correct placeholder syntax and paste location:

```sh
python3 slicer_gcode.py --slicer bambu        # Bambu Studio (same as Orca)
python3 slicer_gcode.py --slicer prusa        # PrusaSlicer
python3 slicer_gcode.py --slicer super        # SuperSlicer
python3 slicer_gcode.py --list                # show all + differences
```

No `paramiko` needed — pure stdlib, runs under any Python 3.

## Verifying it worked

After running the installer, open your printer's gcode console and slice a small test print. You should see something like:

```
// Algorithm: bicubic.
// Default probe count: 11,11.
// Adapted probe count: 4,4.
// Default mesh bounds: (5, 5), (255, 255).
// Adapted mesh bounds: (106.0, 39.0), (154.0, 221.0).
// KAMP adjustments successful. Happy KAMPing!
// KAMP purge starting at 115.0, 29.0 and purging 30.0mm of filament, requested flow rate is 12.0mm3/s.
```

The probe should then walk only the area covering your printed objects.

In `klippy.log`, the override should announce itself on every Klippy restart:

```
[INFO] bed_mesh_override: _BED_MESH_CALIBRATE re-registered to guarded upstream
       (KAMP mode; bare calls are no-ops; MESH_MIN/MAX required to run)
```

## What about Smart_Park?

KAMP-K2 **does not enable** upstream KAMP's `Smart_Park.cfg`. The K2 has its own `BOX_GO_TO_EXTRUDE_POS` macro (part of the CFS filament-change flow) that already parks the nozzle at a reasonable location during print prep. Adding Smart_Park on top would just override that with a parking location near the first layer — which the printer was about to move to anyway. If you have a strong reason to enable it, uncomment the line in `KAMP_Settings.cfg` by hand after install.

## Reverting

Run the installer with `--revert` (not yet implemented — see Issues) or restore the backup that the installer makes at:

- `/mnt/exUDISK/.system/kamp_k2_backup_<timestamp>/` (on printers with the external SSD), or
- `/mnt/UDISK/printer_data/config/backups/kamp_k2_<timestamp>/` (without SSD)

Then remove `extras/restore_bed_mesh.py`, remove `[restore_bed_mesh]` and `[include KAMP/KAMP_Settings.cfg]` from `printer.cfg`, and restart Klippy.

## Tuning

If you want adaptive meshing to run fewer probe points on small parts (faster mesh time, same first-layer quality), see [`docs/tuning.md`](docs/tuning.md). Default ceiling on most K2s is `probe_count: 11,11` — the doc explains when and why dropping it to `7,7` (Creality's own default) or lower is worth doing, and when it isn't.

## How it works (deeper)

- [`docs/how-it-works.md`](docs/how-it-works.md) — the full hijack stack and why each piece is needed
- [`docs/tuning.md`](docs/tuning.md) — optional `probe_count` tuning and `MESH=0` skip-mesh flag

## Companion project

[**K2-Screws-Tilt**](https://github.com/grant0013/K2-Screws-Tilt) — brings Klipper's `SCREWS_TILT_CALCULATE` helper to the K2 family. Uses your existing strain-gauge probe to tell you "front-left: turn 1/4 CW" for manual bed-screw levelling. Same one-click Windows installer, same backup/revert UX. Confirmed on K2 Combo.
